# Extracting, Transforming, and Loading Crowdfunding Data

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to have a better ability to analyze growing crowdfunding data for company stakeholders and individuals who donating to the crowdfunding platform. Using the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process, data on project backers was extracted from a large excel file, tranformed using python and pandas, and loaded onto a PostgreSQL database. SQL queries were then used to perform an analysis on the backers contact information.

## Analysis Results

An analysis of the backers information showed that a total of 8175 individuals are backing live projects, with the remaining goal amounts currently being backed ranging from $153,288 to $426.

## Summary
By using the ETL process, insights such as the project's remaining goal amount can be communicated to project backers much easier. A better sense of the number of live backers can be drawn, and the crowdfunding company can continue to scale their ability to analyze information and draw better insights.
